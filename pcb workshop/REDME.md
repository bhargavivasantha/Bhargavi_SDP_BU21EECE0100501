TOPIC – Touch Sensor Using BJT

INTRODUCTION –

Touch sensors are innovative devices that respond to changes in capacitance resulting from static charges generated by conductive objects. Their unique working principle enables them to detect touch interactions, making them ideal for various applications, including touch-sensitive buttons and interactive surfaces.

SIMULATION RESULTS –

Touch sensors work similarly to a switch. When they are subjected to touch, pressure, or force, they activate and act as a closed switch. When the pressure or contact is removed it acts as an open switch. A capacitive touch sensor contains two parallel conductors with an insulator between them. These conductors' plates act as capacitors with a capacitance value of C0.

When these conductor plates come in contact with our fingers, our finger acts as a conductive object. Due to this, there will be an uncertain increase in the capacitance. A capacitance measuring circuit continuously measures the capacitance C0 of the sensor. When this circuit detects a change in capacitance it generates a signal.

The resistive touch sensors calculate the pressure applied on the surface to sense the touch. These sensors contain two conductive films coated with indium tin oxide, which is a good conductor of electricity, separated by a very small distance. Across the surface of the films, a constant voltage is applied. When pressure is applied to the top film, it touches the bottom film. This generates a voltage drop which is detected by a controller circuit and the signal is generated thereby detecting the touch.

Digital circuit

Topic – 4-bit Full adder

INTRODUCTION –

A 4-bit full adder is a digital circuit that performs the arithmetic addition of two 4-bit binary numbers. This essential component in digital electronics is widely used in computing and digital signal-processing applications. The circuit calculates the sum of the input bits and handles the carry input and output, ensuring accurate arithmetic operations.

SIMULATION RESULTS –

The Four Bit Full Adder works interestingly. The XOR Gates are responsible for the addition of input bits. To get the full addition circuit we attach two AND gates with the circuit in such a way that the result of addition connects the OR Gate and we get the carry.

In the designing of the circuit, we simply make a small circuit of AND Gate and XOR Gate. Then we design a Circuit of **two bits Full Adder**. The cynosure of the circuit is, that we'll copy the block and arrange four blocks in a way that the output carry of the block becomes the input carry of the next. This cycle will continue and at the  fourth block we get the resultant carry of the whole calculation
